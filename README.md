In our nation, sanitation has always been a major issue. At present, sanitation and water 
shortage has always been a major issue. Most significantly, this issue is not just 
concentrated to the rural areas but is also wide spread in urban and semi urban areas. 
People do not show the same level of concern when it comes to keeping the public 
sanitation systems clean as they show towards the ones at their homes as well as when it 
comes to use of water during flushing. Right to good health and sanitation is one of the 
goals to be achieved as per the Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations 
Organization, 2000.Toilet flushers are known for consuming almost one third of the 
water in buildings. They use excessive amount of water during the flush time which 
automatically results in the shortage of water. 

However, in India the scenario of public toilets is still dismal. One of the reasons for this 
is that the people do not bother to clean up or hate touching the toilet lever after they use 
the toilet. These places are thus the breeding grounds of bacterial germs like Escherichia 
coli and many deadly diseases. Many people sometime prefer discomfort to using these 
toilets. 

Looking at such troubles, the decision to construct an automatic-flushing toilet was made 
that simply reduce the amount of toilet flushing water while keeping it clean. The timing 
of the person using it as its working mechanism. The proposed Automatic water flush 
system for sanitation in public toilets is designed and implemented using Aurdino. In 
manual flush systems, the user presses a button, which opens a flush valve allowing 
mains-pressure water to flow into the bowl, or sometimes the user presses directly a flush 
lever. The valve contains an air-filled mechanism that closes it after a preset time. An 
Aurdino based system using sensor technology; this automatic flush System is designed. 
In this valve of the toilet tank will be open for a fixed interval of time if the person is 
using it for urination or removal of extra waste respectively.


A safety feature is also added for the old peoples which are fall detection mechanism in which 
when a person falls near the washroom it alerts others with the help of a buzzer. In this 
mechanism, a pattern of laser light is used if that pattern is distorted then it alerts that the person 
has been fallen. 
The design is robust and effective. Sensors or any kind of electrical transducers are not required 
in the construction of these toilets. As the old saying goes "cleanliness is next to godliness", this 
is a public welfare project which aims to propagate a cleaner and hygienic society and hence, 
take our nation to the heights of glory.
