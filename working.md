There is a cleaning algorithm stored in Arduino. In this system there is minimum usage of water & 
electricity. There we also use security fall system for old person. Security fall system is a 
combination of IR sensors. To maintain the cleanliness level Ultrasonic sensors are used. In this 
machine, two storage tanks are used one for flush water and other for waste water. two ultrasonic 
sensors are used for different purpose, one for urination and other for faeces. These ultrasonic sensors 
work with hand gestures, User has to show his hand palm near the sensor. These two ultrasonic 
sensors give signal to solenoid valve and this solenoid valve gets open for a particular period of time 
for different sensors. IR sensors, Buzzer and a 16*2 Alphanumeric LCD is used. A pattern of IR 
sensors is used, when a single layer of IR sensor is goes high, nothing happens. But when all 4 IR 
sensors is goes high, it gives signal to Buzzer and LED. LED get glow and Buzzer buzz, which 
indicate that someone falls in the bathroom. The whole system of flush requires 12V power supply to 
operate.
